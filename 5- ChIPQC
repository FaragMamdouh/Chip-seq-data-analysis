# SampleID: Identifier string for sample
# Tissue, Factor, Condition: Identifier strings for up to three different factors (You will need to have all columns listed. If you don't have infomation, then set values to NA)
# Replicate: Replicate number of sample
# bamReads: file path for BAM file containing aligned reads for ChIP sample
# ControlID: an identifier string for the control sample
# bamControl: file path for bam file containing aligned reads for control sample
# Peaks: path for file containing peaks for sample
# PeakCaller: Identifier string for peak caller used. Possible values include “raw”, “bed”, “narrow”, “macs”

# These metrics include read depth, read length, and duplication rate. The read depth and length can be useful to note, especially if there appear to be large differences across samples.
# There are a few metrics that we usually explore when determining whether we have a strong enrichment of reads in peaks, including RiP, SSD, and RiBL.
# RiP (Reads in Peaks) should be higher than 5%
# RiBL (Reads overlapping in Blacklisted Regions): Lower RiBL percentages are better than higher.
