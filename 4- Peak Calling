#narrowPeak: is used by the ENCODE project to provide called peaks of signal enrichment based on pooled, normalized (interpreted) data.
# It is a BED 6+4 format, which means the first 6 columns of a standard BED file with 4 additional fields:
# _peaks.narrowPeak: BED6+4 format file which contains the peak locations together with peak summit, pvalue and qvalue
# _peaks.xls: a tabular file which contains information about called peaks. Additional information includes pileup and fold enrichment
# _summits.bed: peak summits locations for every peak. To find the motifs at the binding sites, this file is recommended
# _model.R: an R script which you can use to produce a PDF image about the model based on your data and cross-correlation plot
# _control_lambda.bdg: bedGraph format for input sample
# _treat_pileup.bdg: bedGraph format for treatment sample
